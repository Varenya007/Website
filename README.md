The system has detected an anomaly in your perception. To proceed, you must make a choice:

**Choose the Blue Pill...**
This repository will appear as a simple collection of code files. You will continue to browse GitHub, believing that the project is nothing more than static text and images. The story ends here.

**...or Choose the Red Pill.**
Click onto <https://varenya007.github.io/Website/> and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

### System Architecture

The application is structured as a series of interconnected nodes, each serving a specific function:

* `how-to-guides/`: Has stuff I've tried simplified. 

* `blogs/`: Books I've read, Progress on my running journey and thoughts I've thought are going to be here :)

* `projects/`: Has stuff I've broken my head over for a while.

* `about/`: If you want to chat.
